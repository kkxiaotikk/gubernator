# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2020-01-04
### Added
* Allow cache users to invalidate a ratelimit after a specific time
* Changing limit and duration before expire should now work correctly
* Added Behavior RESET_REMAINING to reset any hits recorded in the cache for the
  specified rate limit

## Changes
* TokenBucketItem is now provided when `OnChange()` is called instead of `RateLimitResp`
* Fixed a bug in global behaviour where it would return an error if the async
  update had not occured before the a second request is made. Now it acts like it
  owns the rate limit until the owning node sends an update
* Always include reset_time in leaky bucket responses
* Fixed subtle bug during shutdown where PeerClient passed into goroutine could
  be out of scope/changed when routine runs
* Behavior is now a flag, this should be a backward compatible change for
  anyone using GLOBAL or NO_BATCHING but will break anyone using
  DURATION_IS_GREGORIAN. Use `HasBehavior()` function to check for behavior
  flags.
